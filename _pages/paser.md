I lead the **P**ractical and **A**ctionable **S**oftware **E**ngineering **R**esearch (**PASER**) group at Tennessee Tech University. Members of the PASER group work on software engineering research problems that have real-world implications for practitioners. I am extremely pleased to work with members of the PASER group who are my students and collaborators.
