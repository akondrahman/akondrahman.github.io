Hi there! I am Akond, an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.tntech.edu/engineering/programs/csc/index.php) at [Tennessee Tech University](https://www.tntech.edu/). I am also a faculty associate at [CEROC](https://www.tntech.edu/ceroc/). 

Research Interests 
======
My research interests are in software engineering focused on DevOps and Secure Software Development. I rely on a wide range of techniques, such as constraint solving, program analysis, qualitative analysis, and statistical methods to pursue my research goals. 


Academic Achievements
======
I was awarded the NC State CSC Outstanding Dissertation Award and the
[NC State College of Engineering Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://tinyurl.com/akond-coe)
from NC State University for my PhD dissertation titled [Anti-patterns in Infrastructure as Code](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/36715).
Previously, I won the [ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/info/awards) at ICSE 2019.
I am also winner of the ACM SIGSOFT Doctoral Symposium Award at ICSE 2018, and the [Microsoft Open Source Challenge Grand Prize](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/opening-the-door-to-innovation-winners-of-the-first-microsoft-open-source-challenge-announced/) in 2016.
