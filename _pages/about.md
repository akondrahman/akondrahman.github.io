Hi there! I am Akond, an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE)](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/comp/) at [Auburn University](https://eng.auburn.edu/). I am also a faculty member at the [Auburn Cyber Research Center](https://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/auburn-cyber-research-center/index.html).  

Research Interests 
======
My research interests are in software engineering focused on DevOps and Secure Software Development. I rely on a wide range of techniques, such as model checking, program analysis, and statistical methods to pursue my research goals. My research has been graciously supported by grants from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).  


Academic Achievements
======
I was awarded the NC State CSC Outstanding Dissertation Award and the
[NC State College of Engineering Distinguished Dissertation Award](https://tinyurl.com/akond-coe)
from NC State University for my PhD dissertation titled [Anti-patterns in Infrastructure as Code](https://repository.lib.ncsu.edu/handle/1840.20/36715).
Previously, I won the [ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award](https://2019.icse-conferences.org/info/awards) at ICSE 2019.
I am also winner of the ACM SIGSOFT Doctoral Symposium Award at ICSE 2018, and the [Microsoft Open Source Challenge Grand Prize](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/opening-the-door-to-innovation-winners-of-the-first-microsoft-open-source-challenge-announced/) in 2016. 


Background
======
I completed my PhD in Computer Science at [North Carolina State University](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/), where I was supervised by [Dr. Laurie Williams](https://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/). I was born in [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh), a beautiful country in South Asia. I completed my B.Sc. at [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology](https://www.buet.ac.bd/), and M.Sc. at [University of Connecticut](https://uconn.edu/).
