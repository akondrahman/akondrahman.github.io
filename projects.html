            group at Tennessee Tech University. The <i>PASER</i> group is currently focusing on the following research projects:</p>

        <h2>eSLIC: Enhanced Security Static Analysis for Configuration Scripts</h2>
        <p>
        <br />
        <b>Abstract:</b> he project will focus on the development of techniques and tools that will automatically 
        detect security weaknesses in configuration scripts developed using a wide range of languages heavily used 
        in industry. Three main tasks will be investigated for this project. First, qualitative analysis is applied 
        in order to determine a comprehensive list of security weaknesses for multiple configuration script languages, and 
        devise static analysis techniques for automatically identifying each category of security weakness. Next, 
        grammar-based parsing and machine learning techniques are applied, evaluated, and integrated into the derived 
        static analysis so that false positives are reduced. Finally, the development context of practitioners from the 
        open source and proprietary domain will be systematically mined to generate actionable alerts and suggestions, which 
        will enable practitioners to fix security weaknesses. Along with the three technical tasks, industry panels will 
        be organized, where practitioners from industry will give feedback on the developed techniques and tools. Findings 
        from the project will be disseminated to government, industry and open source practitioners, as well as to students 
        who are learning 
        about configuration management in graduate and undergraduate level courses related to cybersecurity

        <h2>Secure Development of Machine Learning</h2>
        <p>
        <br />
        <b>Abstract:</b> The ubiquitous use of machine learning necessitates to make the deevlopment process secure. 
        In this project we are exploring so strategies used to secure the development process for traditional software 
        engineering can also be integrated in machine learning development. In particular, we are investigating how to perform 
        logging to diagnose adversarial machine learning attacks and formally verify security specifications in machine 
        learning implementations.

        <h2>Building the Foundations of Validation for the Julia Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>
        <br />
        <b>Abstract:</b> Software validation activities, such as software testing and static analysis, 
        are resource-consuming. Insights on 
        what categories of defects appear in software can help practitioners understand the nature of software defects and 
        prioritize validation activities accordingly. Defect categorization can 
        provide insights on the nature of defects that appear in Julia programs and how tools related to validation 
        can be constructed. 

        Julia is an emerging programming language that was designed to provide programming syntax similar to that of scripting languages, 
        such as Python, with similar program execution speed of compiled languages with low-level memory access, 
        such as C. According to a survey of Stack Overflow users in 2020, Julia is considered as one of 
        the <i>top 10 most loved programming languages</i>. The poplarity of Julia as a programming langauge motivates us to construct 
        validation tools, such as fuzzing tools and static analysis tools so that potential defects can be mitigated early at the 
        development stage. We are applying dynamic analysis tools, such as the <i>American Fuzzy Lop</i> to find bugs in the Julia 
        compiler. We are also creating a security static analysis tool to find security weaknesses in Julia programs. As of today no
        security static analysis tools exist for Julia programs.
