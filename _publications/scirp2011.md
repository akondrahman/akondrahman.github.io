Target tracking is considered as one of the cardinal applications of a wireless sensor network. Tracking multiple targets is more challenging than tracking a single target in a wireless sensor network due to targets’ movement in different directions, targets’ speed variations and frequent connectivity failures of low powered sensor nodes. If all the low-powered sensor nodes are kept active in tracking multiple targets coming from different directions of the network, there is high probability of network failure due to wastage of power. It would be more realistic if the tracking area can be reduced so that less number of sensor nodes will be active and therefore, the network will consume less energy. Tracking area can be reduced by using the target’s kinematics. There is almost no method to track multiple targets based on targets’ kinematics. In our paper, we propose a distributed tracking method for tracking multiple targets considering targets’ kinematics. We simulate our method by a sensor network simulator OMNeT++ and empirical results state that our proposed methodology outperforms traditional tracking algorithms.
