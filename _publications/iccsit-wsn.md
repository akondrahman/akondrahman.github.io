Multiple targets tracking is one of the challenging applications in a wireless sensor network due to targets' movement in different directions, targets' speed variations and frequent connectivity failures of low powered sensor nodes. If all the low-powered sensor nodes are kept active in tracking multiple targets' coming from different directions of the network, there is high probability of network failure due to the wastage of power. It would be more realistic, if, according to the priority of service, sensor nodes are classified and are kept active. Then, it is possible to reduce energy consumption. In our paper, we propose a distributed tracking framework incorporating sensor network properties which results into a novel service priority based dynamic tracking framework. We simulate our method by a sensor network simulator OMNeT++. We find that our architecture saves energy significantly.
