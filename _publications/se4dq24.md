Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the practice of automatically managing computing platforms, such as Internet of Things (IoT) platforms. IaC has gained popularity in recent years, yielding a plethora of software artifacts, such as Ansible playbooks that are available on social coding platforms. Despite the availability of open source software (OSS) Ansible playbooks, there is a lack of empirical research on the quality of these playbooks, which can hinder the progress of IaC-related research. To that end, we conduct an empirical study with 2,952 OSS Ansible playbooks where we evaluate the quality of OSS playbooks from the perspective of executability, i.e., if publicly available OSS Ansible playbooks can be executed without failures. From our empirical study, we observe 71.5% of the mined 2,952 Ansible playbooks cannot be executed as is because of four categories of failures.
