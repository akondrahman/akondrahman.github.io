This work in progress (WIP) paper presents our experience related to two exercises that focus on automated security static analysis, a practice used to integrate security into development and operations (DevOps). The concept has gained popularity amongst information technology (IT) organizations. However, security-related concerns, such as security weaknesses in DevOps artifacts can cause serious consequences. Our preliminary findings indicate that (i) students positively perceive the introduced exercises; and (ii) the students perform well if they are provided necessary background on the exercises. Our WIP paper lays the groundwork to build course materials that will facilitate development, deployment, and dissemination of DevOps-related education materials that also incorporate cybersecurity concepts.
