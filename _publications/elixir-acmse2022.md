Since its inception in 2011, Elixir has emerged as a popular programming language. Currently, Elixir is used in a diverse set of domains, such as instant messaging, smart farming, and e-commerce. Usage of Elixir in above-mentioned domains necessitates gaining an understanding of the state of vulnerabilities that are reported for Elixir programs. An empirical analysis of vulnerability-related commits, i.e., commits that indicate action taken to mitigate vulnerabilities, can help us understand how frequently vulnerabilities appear in Elixir programs. Such understanding can also be a starting point to integrate secure software development practices into the Elixir ecosystem. We conduct an empirical study where we mine 4,446 commits from 25 open source Elixir repositories from GitHub. Our findings show that (i) 2.0% of the 4,446 commits are vulnerability-related, (ii) 18.0% of the 1,769 Elixir programs in our dataset are modified in vulnerability-related commits, and (iii) the proportion of vulnerability-related commits is highest in 2020. Despite Elixir being perceived as a `safe` language, our empirical study shows programs written in Elixir to contain vulnerabilities. Based on our findings, we recommend researchers to investigate the root causes of introducing vulnerabilities in Elixir programs.
