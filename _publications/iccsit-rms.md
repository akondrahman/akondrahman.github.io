Nowadays mobile phones are expected to handle huge volume of multimedia data which is very challenging due to the small memory size of the mobile phone sets. We have developed an application that incorporates a novel technique which uses and enhances the Record Management Store (RMS), a subsystem of Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP), which not only captures, upload and download multimedia data efficiently but also provides significant improvement over existing mobile applications in terms of portability and security. We illustrate our improvements by empirical analyses.
