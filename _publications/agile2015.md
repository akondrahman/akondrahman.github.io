Continuous deployment speeds up the process of existing agile methods, such as Scrum, and Extreme Programming (XP) through the automatic deployment of software changes to end-users upon passing of automated tests. Continuous deployment has become an emerging software engineering process amongst numerous software companies, such as Facebook, Github, Netflix, and Rally Software. A systematic analysis of software practices used in continuous deployment can facilitate a better understanding of continuous deployment as a software engineering process. Such analysis can also help software practitioners in having a shared vocabulary of practices and in choosing the software practices that they can use to implement continuous deployment. *The goal of this paper is to aid software practitioners in implementing continuous deployment through a systematic analysis of software practices that are used by software companies.* We studied the continuous deployment practices of 19 software companies by performing a qualitative analysis of Internet artifacts and by conducting follow-up inquiries. In total, we found 11 software practices that are used by 19 software companies. We also found that in terms of use, eight of the 11 software practices are common across 14 software companies. We observe that continuous deployment necessitates the consistent use of sound software engineering practices such as automated testing, automated deployment, and code review.
