The ubiquitous usage of robots in modern society necessitates secure development of robotics systems. Practitioners who engage in robot development can benefit from a systematic study that investigates the categories of vulnerabilities that appear in robotics systems. *The goal of this paper is to help practitioners mitigate vulnerabilities in robotics systems by conducting an empirical study of vulnerabilities in robotics systems.* We conduct an empirical study where we analyze 176 robotics-related vulnerabilities collected from the Robot Vulnerability Database (RVD). Our findings show that: (i) robotics-related vulnerabilities can be classified into nine categories; (ii) memory-related vulnerabilities are the most frequent category, (iii) 92.6% of the reported vulnerabilities are software-related, and (iv) software components in robotics systems include more critical vulnerabilities compared to that of hardware components. Based on our findings, we provide a list of development activities that can be used to mitigate vulnerabilities for robotics systems.
